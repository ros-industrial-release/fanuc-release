Description: ROS-Industrial support for the Fanuc CRX-10iA (and variants).
 This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for Fanuc CRX-10iA manipulators. This currently includes the /L model only. Specifications: CRX-10iA/L - 1418mm reach Joint limits and maximum joint velocities are based on the information in the FANUC Robot CRX-10iA, CRX-10iA/L Mechanical Unit Operator's Manual version B-84194EN/01. All urdfs are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options). Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
