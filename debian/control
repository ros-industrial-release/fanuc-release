Description: ROS-Industrial support package for the Fanuc R-2000iB (and variants).
 This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for Fanuc R-2000iB manipulators. This currently includes the /210F variant only. Specifications: R-2000iB/210F - &quot;J1 - Normal Range&quot; Joint limits and maximum joint velocities are based on the information in the FANUC R-2000iB Mechanical Unit Operator's Manual version B-82234EN/11. All urdfs are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options). Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
