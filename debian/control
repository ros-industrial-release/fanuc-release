Description: ROS-Industrial support for the Fanuc R-2000iC (and variants).
 This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for Fanuc R-2000iC manipulators. This includes the /125L, /165F, /210F, /210L and /270F variants. Note: for use with current ROS packages, the /210F is identical to the /165F and reuses the meshes, kinematic structure and the OPW parameters of the /165. Only the joint limits are different. Specifications: R-2000iC/125L - &quot;Conventional dress-out&quot; R-2000iC/165F - &quot;Conventional dress-out&quot; R-2000iC/210F - &quot;Conventional dress-out&quot; R-2000iC/210L - &quot;Conventional dress-out&quot; R-2000iC/270F - &quot;Conventional dress-out&quot; Joint limits and maximum joint velocities are based on the information in the FANUC Robot R-2000iC Mechanical Unit Operator's Manual version B-83644EN/01. All urdfs are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options). Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them with. Contributors: This support package has received contributions from: Timo Birnkraut and Simon Schmeisser (125L), Didier Quirin (210F), Haris Suwignyo (Alten Nederland) (270F) and Ademola Oridate (Wilder Systems) (210L).
