Description: ROS-Industrial support for the Fanuc CR-7iA (and variants).
 This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for Fanuc CR-7iA manipulators. This currently includes the base and /L model. Specifications: CR-7iA - Normal Range CR-7iA/L - Normal Range Link lengths are based on information in FANUC Robot CR-4iA, CR-7iA, CR-7iA/L, CR-14iA/L Mechanical Unit Operator's Manual version B-83774EN/04. Joint limits and maximum joint velocities are based on the information in the system variables of the supported variants (either from FRVCs or real controllers). All urdfs are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options). Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them with. Note: collaborative robots make use of special safety systems embedded in the OEM controller which continuously monitor the state of the robot and adapt limits where and when necessary. The joint limits specified in the xacros provided by this package are the maximum joint limits as specified by Fanuc. As there is no information available on how the collaborative safety system works, we cannot model it here and thus it's very likely the joint limits in these files are unattainable by the actual robot.
