Description: ROS-Industrial support for the Fanuc M-710iC (and variants).
 This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for Fanuc M-710iC manipulators. This currently includes the /45M and /50 variants. Joint limits and maximum joint velocities are based on the information in the FANUC Robot M-710iC Mechanical Unit Operator's Manual version B-82274EN/09. All urdfs are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options). Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
