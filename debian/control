Description: ROS-Industrial support for the Fanuc M-900iB (and variants).
 This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for Fanuc M-900iB manipulators. This currently includes the /700 variant only. Specifications: M-900iB/700 - Standard Flange Joint limits and maximum joint velocities are based on the information in the FANUC Robot M-900iB/700 Mechanical Unit Operator's Manual version B-83444EN/01. All urdfs are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options). Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them with. Note 1: the xacro for the /700 variant includes optional geometry for the forklift pockets, balancers and counterweight that can be enabled and disabled to correspond to the robot's actual configuration. By default, only the balancers and the counterweight are included, but this can be changed by making use of the provided xacro macro. Note 2: visualisation of the balancers and the counterweight is an approximation only and may not always accurately represent the state of the physical robot.
