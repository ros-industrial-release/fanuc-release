Description: ROS-Industrial support for the Fanuc R-1000iA (and variants).
 This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for Fanuc R-1000iA manipulators. This currently includes the /80F only. Specifications: R-1000iA/80F - &quot;flange: standard flange&quot;, &quot;motion range: standard type&quot; Joint limits and maximum joint velocities are based on the information in the FANUC Robot R-1000iA Mechanical Unit Operator's Manual version B-83004EN/03. All urdfs are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options). Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
