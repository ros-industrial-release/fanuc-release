Description: ROS-Industrial support for the Fanuc M-20iA / ARC Mate 120iC (and variants).
 This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for Fanuc M-20iA / ARC Mate 120iC manipulators. This currently includes the base model and /10L. Specifications: M-20iA - &quot;Cable integrated J3 Arm&quot; M-20iA/10L - &quot;Cable integrated J3 Arm&quot; Joint limits and maximum joint velocities are based on the information in the FANUC Robot ARC Mate 120iC, FANUC Robot M-20iA Mechanical Unit Operator's Manual version B-82874EN/06. All urdfs are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options). Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them with. Contributors: This support package has received contributions from: Joe Spanier (M-20iA/10L).
