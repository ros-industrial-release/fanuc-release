Description: ROS-Industrial support for the Fanuc M-10iA (and variants). This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for Fanuc M-10iA manipulators. This currently includes the base model only. Specifications: M-10iA - &quot;Conventional dress-out&quot; Joint limits and maximum joint velocities are based on the information in the FANUC Robot M-10iA Mechanical Unit Operator's Manual version B-82754EN/09. All urdfs are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options). Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
