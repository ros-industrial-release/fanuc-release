Description: ROS Industrial support for the Fanuc M-16iB / ARC Mate 120iB (and variants). This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for Fanuc M-16iB / ARC Mate 120iB manipulators. This currently includes the /20 only. Specifications: M-16iB/20 - &quot;Default J1 range&quot; Joint limits and maximum joint velocities are based on the information in the FANUC Robot ARC Mate 120iB, Fanuc Robot M-16iB/20 Mechanical Unit Maintenance Manual version B-81765EN/02. All urdfs are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options). Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
