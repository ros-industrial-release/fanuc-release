Description: ROS-Industrial support for the Fanuc CR-7iA (and variants).
 This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for Fanuc CR-7iA manipulators. This currently includes the base and /L model. Specifications: CR-7iA - Normal Range CR-7iA/L - Normal Range Joint limits and maximum joint velocities are based on the information in the FANUC Robot CR-7iA Mechanical Unit Operator's Manual version B-83774EN/01. All urdfs are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options). Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
