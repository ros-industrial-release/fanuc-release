%description
ROS-Industrial support for the Fanuc M-430iA (and variants). This package
contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for Fanuc M-430iA
manipulators. This currently includes the /2F and /2P. Specifications:
M-430iA/2F - &quot;Default J1 range&quot; M-430iA/2P - &quot;Default J1
range&quot; Joint limits and maximum joint velocities are based on the
information in the FANUC Robot M-430iA Mechanical Unit Operator's Manual version
B-82554EN/05. All urdfs are based on the default motion and joint velocity
limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended /
limited motion ranges or other options). Before using any of the configuration
files and / or meshes included in this package, be sure to check they are
correct for the particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them
with.
