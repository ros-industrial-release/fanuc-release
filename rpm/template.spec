%description
MoveIt plugins for the Fanuc M-10iA (and variants). This package contains
plugins for use with MoveIt and Fanuc M-10iA manipulators. Plugins included
support the base model. See the Fanuc M-10iA support package for information on
used joint angle and velocity limits. Before using any of the plugins included

model and configuration you intend to use them with.
