%description
MoveIt plugins for the Fanuc LR Mate 200iC (and variants). This package
contains plugins for use with MoveIt and Fanuc LR Mate 200iC manipulators.
Plugins included support the base model (/5C, /5WP), /5H, /5L (/5LC), /5F and
the /5HS (using the /5H plugin). Variants in brackets are supported by the
plugin of the referenced model. See the Fanuc LR Mate 200iC support package for
information on used joint angle and velocity limits. Before using any of the
plugins included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the
particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
