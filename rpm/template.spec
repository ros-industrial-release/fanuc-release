%description
ROS-Industrial support for the Fanuc M-6iB (and variants). This package
contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for Fanuc M-6iB
manipulators. This currently includes the base model only. Specifications: M-6iB
- Normal Range Joint limits and maximum joint velocities are based on the
information in the FANUC Robot ARC Mate 100i Model B, FANUC Robot M-6i Model B
Maintenance Manual version B-81545EN/01. All urdfs are based on the default
motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for
high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options). Before
using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included in this package,
be sure to check they are correct for the particular robot model and
configuration you intend to use them with.
