%description
MoveIt plugins for the Fanuc LR Mate 200iB (and variants). This package
contains plugins for use with MoveIt and Fanuc LR Mate 200iB manipulators.
Plugins included support the base model and the /3L variant. See the Fanuc LR
Mate 200iB support package for information on used joint angle and velocity
limits. Before using any of the plugins included in this package, be sure to
check they are correct for the particular robot model and configuration you
intend to use them with.
