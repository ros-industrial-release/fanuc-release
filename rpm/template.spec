%description
ROS-Industrial support for the Fanuc LR Mate 200iB (and variants). This package
contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for Fanuc LR Mate 200iB
manipulators. This currently includes the base model and the /3L. Joint limits
and maximum joint velocities are based on the information in the Fanuc LR Mate
200iB-200iB/3L datasheet, dated 24-Feb-2003. All urdfs are based on the default
motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for
high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options). Before
using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included in this package,
be sure to check they are correct for the particular robot model and
configuration you intend to use them with. Contributors: This support package
has received contributions from: Victor Lamoine.
