%description
MoveIt plugins for the Fanuc M-6iB (and variants). This package contains
plugins for use with MoveIt and Fanuc M-6iB manipulators. Plugins included
support the base model only. See the Fanuc M-6iB support package for information
on used joint angle and velocity limits. Before using any of the plugins
included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular
robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
